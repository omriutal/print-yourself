# print-yourself
an one file based program that prints itself. written in c90.
It gets no arguments and when trying to pass an argument to it an error massage will be printed.
It works both in Linux and in Windows.
To run it, you first need to compile it with the following line:
  gcc -ansi -pedantic -Wall prnt.c -o prnt
 * prnt can be changed and the program will still work.
 * the program name has to be the same as the .c file.
